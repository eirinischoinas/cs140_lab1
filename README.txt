Report for Question 2.a

For the upper-triangular case with n=4096 and t=1024, the single-process baseline completed in 10.43 seconds at 1.65 GFLOPS. 
Running with 2 MPI processes reduced runtime to 7.62 seconds (2.25 GFLOPS), giving a speedup of about 1.37x, 
while 4 processes further reduced runtime to 4.28 seconds (4.01 GFLOPS), a speedup of roughly 2.43x. 
This corresponds to efficiencies of approximately 68% on 2 cores and 61% on 4 cores.
